Meeting notes:

Recap:
    -said we (nok and suda) we're going to write down the algorithm for realtime requests

Things we need to consider:
    -emergency requests -> therefore, we may need a new cost (define cost for changing out a request) 


How to handle emergency requests:
    - dont let it override planned requests OR 
    - make a very high cost for overriding planned requests.

Planning horizon:
    - t tau thingy where there is this like sliding window. off of each of these in the path you need to make a case where you do accept that incoming request
    - this case will probably be like hey you only want to accept one per turn but now you will accept two with this huge violation. 

Todo:
    -new violation type
    -sliding window thingy

cannot override planned requests

with each new request, attempt a branch (?)  off of the predetermined path
