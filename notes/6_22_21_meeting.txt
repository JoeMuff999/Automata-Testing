i got my masters!

cool things: very happy I went, was a great time meeting all of the other schools and just being surrounded by people who love motorsports

for this week:
I want to formalize the problem


submit the forms to the box!

see if you can generate that data set using the repository that they have given us. ask suda for the respository 

data set will help us understand if the straws are useful 
dallas and chicago data
chicago is the excel spreadsheet, code takes in the spreadsheet and turns it into origin/destination pair and time of arrival


reach out to apoorv if you need any help, always remember to copy natasha and michael patterson onto the email

maybe talk to suda to step through what he did to get this data up and running. 

once i have the data up and running, then I can validate distributed consensus protocol. 

parameters, results (inputs and outputs), any assumptions I am making. 
build off of the papers that you have

meet wednesday afternoon, 2 central
