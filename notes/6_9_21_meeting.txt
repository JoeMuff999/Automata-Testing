Cluster towers bring it down to about 20 or so of them.


k-means clustering (spatially clustered), some tradeoff between spatial and request density 


play with different time steps. 15 minutes seems reasonable


suda will send you a data set to run with a jupyter notebook

have some sort of spatial constraint latitude and longitude based, just find the distance between two towers and increase the cost between them 


battery, congestion, and FAA constraints (can't just hover). this is why we do the redirecting algorithm. consider that its not just people, and includes cargo and other such things. 

suda will send the CSV file with the coordinates, and you will process this spatially. 

make some concrete distributed computing simulation, potentially a networked simulation

dont fixate on flocking, learn something that I haven't been exposed to. cloud computing. 

multi-agent RL stuff, or maybe distributed computing : things to bring up with Natasha. 

objective is to learn something, not just produce something.
