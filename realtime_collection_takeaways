some bug with randomness...seeding not working. solution is not deterministic for some reason

apparently every label gives you some sort of cost if its unassigned? even finish or all of the number labels were giving costs
(this is about mvp ^^^)
and this too! is about mvp: we had to label each node with a unique id, because the same hash is equivalent under tulip terms :P

in terms of data collection, for the traffic stuff, id probably want to show some percentage of invalid states as time progresses?
just saying total cost is pretty useless in this context, so then I could say percentage invalid after trafic etc etc. i think this would be cool
